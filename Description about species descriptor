This file describes the process of acquiring the species descriptor of our research. 
If you want to obtain functional gene distributions for species other than those in our study, or are interested in our approach to obtaining 
functional genes, the following is a guide to obtaining functional gene distributions from species proteome data.

First, download the proteome file (.faa) of interested species from ncbi.

Second, upload the fasta file into TreeGrafter software (https://github.com/pantherdb/TreeGrafter). 
The software needs to be deployed on a server, if you want to run the software on our server and obtain data, please contact the author.
TreeGrafter will give the annotated result of proteome, transfer the result into .csv, then extract the name column (NAME: xx) .

Finally, go to the Gene list analysis module of Panther website (https://www.pantherdb.org), 
enter the extracted Name list in the enter IDs input box and click submit to obtain the gene function distribution of the specie.
